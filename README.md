# Node.js File System API

This Node.js project provides an API to create text files with the current timestamp and list all text files in a folder. 
It uses Express for the server and Node.js' File System (fs) module for file operations.
The API includes endpoints for creating a file and retrieving all text files in a specified directory. 
Deployment is done via Render, and the code is hosted on GitHub. To use, clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the server.
